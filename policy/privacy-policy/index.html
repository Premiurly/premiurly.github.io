Such third parties include providers of hosting services and technical infrastructure including browser extension developers, blockchain infrastructure providers, third party account management services, customer support services, and marketing services.</li>

<li><em><strong>Legal reasons.</strong></em> We will share personal information outside of Premiurly if we have a good-faith belief that access, use, preservation, or disclosure of the information is reasonably necessary to (i)  enforce applicable terms of service or other agreements, including investigation of potential violations and audits, (ii) detect, prevent, or otherwise address fraud, abuse, security risks, or technical issues, and (iii) protect against harm to the rights, property or safety of Premiurly, our users, or the public as required or permitted by law.</li>

<h4 id="what-rights-do-i-have">What rights do I have?</h4>
<p>Where required by applicable law or regulation, you have the right to ask us for a copy of your personal data; to correct, delete or restrict (stop any active) processing of your personal data; and to obtain the personal data you provide to us for a contract or with your consent in a structured, machine readable format, and to ask us to share (port) this data to another controller. If you are a registered user of the Forum, you may also review and change your personal information on your account profile page.</p>
<p>In addition, you can object to the processing of your personal data in some circumstances (in particular, where we don’t have to process the data to meet a contractual or other legal requirement, or where we are using the data for direct marketing). These rights may be limited, for example if fulfilling your request would reveal personal data about another person, or if you ask us to delete information which we are required by law to keep or have compelling legitimate interests in keeping. We will inform you of relevant exemptions we rely upon when responding to any request you make.</p>
<p>To exercise any of these rights - or get a copy of our legitimate interest balancing tests -  you can get in touch with us using the details set out below. If you have unresolved concerns, you have the right to complain to a data protection authority where you live, work or where you believe a breach may have occurred.</p>
<p>For the provision of information marked as mandatory when you register to use the Forum, if such information is not provided, then you will not be able to use the Forum. All other provision of your information is optional. If you do not provide such information, our provision of certain services to you may be detracted from.</p>
<h4 id="how-long-will-you-retain-my-data">How long will you retain my data?</h4>
<p>We store data for as long as necessary to provide our services. This is a case-by-case determination that depends on things such as the nature of the data, why it is collected and processed, and relevant legal or operational retention needs. Some personal data you can delete whenever you like, some data is deleted automatically, and some data we retain for longer periods of time. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>We will keep the account information you provide to us for as long as you remain an account holder.</li>
<li>We will keep a record of the fact that you have asked us not to send you direct marketing indefinitely, so that we can respect your request in future.</li>
<li>We will keep usage information and analytics data for a reasonable length of time that allows us to provide our services and to understand how people use the Forum.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes business and legal requirements oblige us to retain certain information, for specific purposes, for an extended period of time. Reasons we might retain some data for longer periods of time include security, fraud prevention, financial record-keeping, complying with legal or regulatory requirements, ensuring the continuity of our services, and when there have been direct communications with Premiurly.</p>
